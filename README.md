# Time.txt #

A simple text file to track your time.  Inspired by [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/).

Currently the main focus is transforming shorthand into more descriptive time tracking information; including inferred dates and times, duration calcuations, and day and week totals.

This:

	1/1
	9, 5, do stuff

...becomes:

	Tuesday, January 01, 2013
	=========================
	(8:00) 9a, 5p, do stuff

	Day: 8:00

	Week: 8:00
