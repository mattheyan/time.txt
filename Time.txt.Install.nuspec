    <releaseNotes>

Time.txt 2.5.0, 2021-08-29
==========================
- Fix invalid format error due to "hh:mm" when throwing "travel back in time" exception (use escape character, i.e. "hh\:mm")
- Fix bug that resulted in always adding 12 hours to avoid "travel back in time", even when doing so would still result in "traveling back in time"
- Don't attempt to add 12 hours to avoid "travel back in time" if the input specified AM/PM (see: AnErrorOccursIfItIsBeforeTheLastStartTime)
- Error handling fixes (for "graceful recovery" mode):
  - Write failing line with a leading comment '#' character
  - Finalize pending entries before writing the failing line and exception message
  - Write "ERROR" line in both exception and non-matching cases
  - Don't exit when a line does not match
- Avoid excessively reducing duration when following time blocks are nested

Time.txt 2.4.0, 2021-07-12
==========================
- Fix issue with `System.Drawing.Common` reference
